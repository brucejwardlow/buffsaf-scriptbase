# BuffSAF-scriptbase

This repository contains the original scripts that were developed to compile an SAF file, and the core of the BuffSAF compiler. 

See the :construction:~~[BuffSAF](https://github.com/brucejwardlow/BuffSAF)~~:construction: or [BuffSAF-demo](https://github.com/brucejwardlow/buffsaf-demo) for the fully functional versions. 

There will be no further development on these.
